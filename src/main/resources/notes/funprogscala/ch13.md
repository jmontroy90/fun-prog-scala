### Chapter 13. External effects and I/O

Main hope is to demonstrate the IO Monad as a means to separate out imperative effectful code from managed, functional effects.
In short, demonstrate the difference between effects and side effects - working with effects allows us to _describe_
our code, which is then run through an interpreter. This is the ultimate form of _functional_ - it's almost declarative?!

##### 13.1. FACTORING EFFECTS

Mostly we focus here on on factoring out side effects in code to make it referentially transparent. See the code examples.

The net effect is to change effectful code that goes from some A -> B in a side-effecting way, into code that does:

> A -> D

> D -> B

Here, `D` is a functional description of your code that manages effects, rather than letting impure functions win the day.

##### 13.2. A SIMPLE IO TYPE

Check the code for the IO type. It's a Monad (surprise!).

##### 13.3. AVOIDING THE STACKOVERFLOWERROR

The basic `IO` implementation hits a StackOverflowException because of the `flatMap` definition: `def run = f(self.run).run`. 
The repeated `self.run` calls will build up stack frames. So let's utterly contort ourselves to avoid this by reifying
control flow as a data constructor! The `flatMap` method becomes a `FlatMap` object, and (as seen in code), this helps us
be more precise about when EXACTLY we hit side effects.
