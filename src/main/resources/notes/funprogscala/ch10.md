10.1. WHAT IS A MONOID?
* Consists of:
    1) Some type A
    2) `op` - an associative operator for A
    3) `zero` - an identity value for A
* "a monoid is a type together with a binary operation (op) over that type, satisfying associativity
   and having an identity element (zero)."

10.2. FOLDING LISTS WITH MONOIDS
* Monoids fit perfectly with a fold operation because fold demands exactly `op` and `zero` as args!

10.3. ASSOCIATIVITY AND PARALLELISM
* Monoids lend themselves to parallelization because you know how two values associate and reduce.
* If you can fold it, you can parallelize it!
